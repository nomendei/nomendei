                            The last week, during my morning <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>-consumption routine, I stumbled upon an article with a kind of catchy title: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8x9j3k/depressed-people-see-the-world-more-realistically"><i>Depressive Realism</i>, on vice.com</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Catchy mainly for me and a few others I guess, as I started myself dealing with depression some years ago. I would like to go through the details of that experience as well, but I prefer to keep this post about the topic discussed in that article: are depressive people more likely to see reality as it <b>truly</b> is?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3>Reality cannot be simply defined</h3>
                            <p>
                                I have read other articles like this, and it seems that the authors deal with the concept of <b>reality</b> a bit too easily, as if its definition was universally agreed and concrete.<br/><br/>
                                I understand this kind of reasoning in the context of physical matters: one could try to define, for instance, "what a <b>tree really is</b>".<br/>
                                It's a tangible entity, one can feel it with the 5 senses: touch it, smell it, see it, hear it, maybe taste it... A few people in front of <i>this</i> tree could probably agree on some foundamental truth about it, a middle ground which will provide some shared understanding of what it is: it has a hard body, it has soft leaves whose color is different from the body etc.<br/><br/>But <b>what reality really is</b> sounds like a bigger goal to achieve, definitely something that cannot be simply given.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The same goes for other metaphisical concepts, like <b>meaning</b> or <b>death</b>.
                                The linked article suggests that <b>optimism</b> helps "to avoid facing terrifying concepts like death..." and "... helps us power through a life full of heartache, meaninglessness, and death". This is a very narrow, one sided perspective.<br/>
                                We are not dealing with a <i>tree</i>, a physical being. We are dealing with <i>meaning</i> and <i>death</i>, we are exploring the realm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetics">noetic</a>, of very personal and human perception. That's why when we define death as terrifying, we are assuming a one reality equal for all.<br/>
                                "Death is <b>terryfing</b> and that's the ultimate truth".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My psychotherapist once pointed out that "the part of our brain that is actually connected to an external sensor (eyes, ears etc) is less than 20%". What we ultimately perceive as "real" has been 80% processed by the internal network of our brain, which is composed by memories and emotions of the last (in my case) 31 years and 4 months (fake age). So if it's already a small challenge to agree on how a tree is (although we can touch it and smell it and see it etc), how can we possibly agree on a concept that is <b>purely</b> developed and interpreted by our human minds, like <i>meaning</i> and <i>death</i>? Depressive people see these concept in one way, but it's far fetched to think that there is a way more real than another one. Let's consider some different takes on death and meaning, just to make the point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <h3>Death: terryfing or just... death?</h3>
                                "Death is <b>terryfing</b>", many people say. Do we have the same attitude towards our by now well known tree? If a tree is all crooked, do we say "Oh look at that bad ugly tree"? I don't think so. A crooked tree is never considered bad, it's just crooked.<br/>
                                There are plenty of people that accepted death as part of the cycle and they don't judge it. It's not terryfing, it's just <b>death</b> or even simply <i>death</i>. However you consider it (horrible, awesome, bad...), it will anyway remain <i>death</i>.<br/>
                                It won't make any difference if you like it or not. You can live your life thinking about it, which won't help, or accepting it, and carry on with the next quest.<br/>
                                I don't have a thorough knowledge of Buddhism, but I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Thodol">Bardo Thodol</a> and the way I interpreted it suggests exactly this point: when your clock stops ticking, you can either embrace death and become Buddha, or you can remain plugged to your karma, be fearful and start the loop over.

                                <h3>Humans and meaning</h3>
                                Some time ago I read a very wonderful book by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8608464-the-feeling-of-meaninglessness">Viktor E. Frankl: <b>The Feeling of Meaninglessness</b></a>. I will talk more thoroughly about it on another post. But in a nutshell it goes through the life and work of <a hred="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl">Viktor Frankl</a>, who created a school of mental treatment called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy">Logotherapy</a>.<br/>
                                It is supposed help people deal with the more human, spiritual level of themselves and help them find meaning in life again. Having a meaning is what makes us human and gives us a directed tension that can drive us through our existence to a purpose.<br/>
                                This, again, is another take on life and meaning. Life does not have to be meaninglessness: as long as we feel we are reaching toward something beyond us, our life if being purposeful. And there has been people working on therapeutic methods to help achieving this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am not saying that this is the true interpretation of life, meaning and death. I just wanted to mention an example of a different schools of thought. I don't see why <i>terryfing and meaningless</i> has to be more true than <i>unique and purposeful</i>.
                                There is <i>just</i> the perception of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So rather than racing for who has the most real perception of reality, why don't we just try to focus on what brings us to meaining and, consequently, happiness? 
                            </p>
